# Problem Set 3

*50.003 Elements of Software Construction*

- Please navigate to the folder [`src/main/java/esc/problemset3`](https://github.com/han-keong/50003Pset3/tree/master/src/main/java/esc/problemset3).

- Generated evosuite tests are in [`evosuite-tests`](https://github.com/han-keong/50003Pset3/tree/master/evosuite-tests/esc/problemset3/question7).

- Due to many technical issues, I was not able to get KLEE to run on my Macbook Pro after numerous attempts.  
  I was not able to transfer files to and from the virtual machine.  
  As a result, I was not able to complete Homework 02.  
  However, I have still provided my [`test_simple.c`](https://github.com/han-keong/50003Pset3/blob/master/src/main/java/esc/problemset3/homework02/test_simple.c) program for grading.
